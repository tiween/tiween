# Executive Summary

**Tiween** is Tunisia's first comprehensive cultural agenda platform - a two-sided marketplace connecting culture enthusiasts with cultural venues and professionals. The platform solves the fundamental problem of fragmented cultural event discovery in Tunisia, where information is scattered across venue Facebook pages (posted as images), multiple ticketing platforms with poor UX, and no unified view by date, region, or category.

The platform modernizes the existing tiween.com (Next.js + Strapi v4) while expanding capabilities to include a mobile-first PWA with offline support, integrated ticketing, and a professional venue dashboard. It serves both **consumers** (18-34 digitally-native Tunisians seeking unified cultural discovery) and **professionals** (venue managers and cultural institutions needing modern tools to manage events, reach audiences, and sell tickets).

## What Makes This Special

1. **Only unified cultural agenda in Tunisia** - All disciplines (cinema, theater, concerts, exhibitions), all regions, one platform
2. **Discovery-first, not venue-first** - Find events by what you want to see, when, and where - not limited to knowing venues first
3. **Culture Pass subscription** - Consumer subscription for discounted access (like UGC Illimité in France), creating recurring revenue and venue partnership incentives
4. **Two-sided value creation** - Consumer audience powers B2B value; B2B tools and revenue sustain free consumer access
5. **End-to-end ticketing** - Physical + digital solution with lower fees and better analytics than competitors (Eazytick, Teskerti)
6. **Cultural preservation mission** - Archiving Tunisian artistic works for collective memory
