## 🤖 AI Capability Analysis

### What They Claim

> "EazyTick is equipped with an artificial intelligence module to collect data that will be relevant for various organizers, particularly to better target their international clientele."

### Reality Check

| Aspect                  | Assessment                | Confidence |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| AI exists               | Claimed, not demonstrated | Low        |
| International targeting | Marketing focus           | Medium     |
| Data collection         | Standard analytics likely | Medium     |
| Actionable insights     | Unclear                   | Low        |

## 💬 Common Objections & Responses

### "EazyTick has AI features"

> "They mention AI in their marketing. But have you seen it work? We built AI that actually answers your questions: Which fans are most likely to buy? When should you launch early-bird pricing? What's your optimal ticket price? Let me show you."

### "They support 12 event categories"

> "Categories are easy - execution is hard. We don't just list categories; we optimize for each one. A theatre show needs different tools than a club night. Our platform adapts to YOUR event type."

### "EazyTick has mobile apps"

> "So do we. But does theirs work offline? Does it give you real-time analytics? Can you manage your entire event from your phone? Apps are table stakes - what matters is what the app can DO."

### "They built it during COVID - they understand the problems"

> "COVID taught everyone that ticketing needs to be digital, flexible, and resilient. We learned the same lessons. The question is: who built the better solution? Compare our features side by side."

### "They're focused on international expansion"

> "Interesting that they're looking abroad when they haven't won Tunisia yet. We're focused on being the best platform for Tunisian events first. When you succeed here, we'll grow together."

### "What about their performer directory?"

> "A directory is nice. But does it help performers sell tickets? Our creator tools help artists build audiences, not just get listed. Promotion, analytics, fan engagement - that's what artists need."

## 🆚 Head-to-Head Scenarios

### Scenario: Tech-Savvy Organizer Evaluating AI

**Their Pitch:** "AI-powered insights for international audience targeting"

**Your Counter:** "Let's compare. Here's our AI dashboard - I can show you audience segments, purchase patterns, and optimal pricing for YOUR event type. Can they demo theirs? AI should work, not just sound good."

### Scenario: First-Time Event Organizer

**Their Pitch:** "The most complete solution for all your events"

**Your Counter:** "Complete is nice, but what's the price? They won't tell you until you're committed. We're 0% for organizers, clear from day one. Start with confidence, not surprises."

### Scenario: Nonprofit Seeking Ticketing

**Their Pitch:** "We have donation functionality built in"

**Your Counter:** "Donations are great - we support that too. But nonprofits also need low fees to maximize impact. Our 0% organizer model means more money for your cause, not ours."

### Scenario: Artist Wanting Promotion

**Their Pitch:** "Get listed in our performer directory"

**Your Counter:** "A listing doesn't sell tickets. Our creator tools give you audience insights, promotional support, and fan engagement features. We help you BUILD an audience, not just hope they find you."
