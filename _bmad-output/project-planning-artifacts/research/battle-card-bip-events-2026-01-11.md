## 💰 Pricing Comparison (Critical!)

### Their Model: "Inverted Fee Structure"

| Who            | BIP Events                   | Tiween Target    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Organizers** | 0% (FREE)                    | 0% (Match)       |
| **Buyers**     | 3.5% - 20% (variable slider) | 3% - 5% (Lower!) |

### Key Talking Point

> "BIP charges your fans up to 20% in fees. We cap buyer fees at 5%. Same 0% for you, but your audience pays less. That means more tickets sold."

---

## 💬 Common Objections & Responses

### "BIP Events also has 0% organizer fees"

> "True! We matched that because organizers deserve it. But look at what your fans pay - BIP charges up to 20% buyer fees. We cap at 5%. Your tickets are more affordable, so you sell more."

### "BIP has instant payouts already"

> "So do we. But do they have AI-powered analytics? Audience insights? Dynamic pricing recommendations? We give you the same fast money PLUS the intelligence to make more of it."

### "BIP is built for live music - that's what we do"

> "BIP is great for clubs and concerts. But what about your acoustic show at a theatre? Your art exhibition? Your corporate launch? We support ALL your events, not just the loud ones."

### "BIP's cashless system is really good"

> "BipPay is solid for on-site sales. Our system does that too - plus integrates with your ticketing data. See which fans bought drinks, merchandise, and tickets all in one dashboard."

### "Their scanning app works offline"

> "Ours too. We built it because we know Tunisian venue WiFi. But our app also syncs instantly when connection returns and gives you real-time attendance analytics."

### "I already use BIP and it works fine"

> "If it's working, that's great. But are you reaching your full audience? Our lower buyer fees mean cheaper tickets for fans. Run your next event on both platforms - see which sells more."

## 🗣️ Positioning Statements

### Against BIP (General)

> "BIP is great for concerts. But Tunisia's culture is more than nightlife. Theatre, cinema, sports, art - Tiween supports it all, with lower fees for your fans."

### For Price-Conscious Buyers

> "Same 0% for organizers, but your fans pay up to 75% less in fees. 5% max vs their 20%. More affordable tickets = more sales."

### For Diverse Event Organizers

> "BIP built their platform for DJs and bands. We built ours for all of Tunisian culture - from Carthage Festival to your local theatre."

### For Data-Driven Organizers

> "BIP tells you how many tickets sold. We tell you WHO bought them, WHEN they decided, and HOW to reach more like them."

### For Arabic-Speaking Organizers

> "BIP's interface is French-first. Ours speaks Arabic natively. Built for Tunisia, not translated for Tunisia."

## ⚠️ Don't Do This

| Mistake                           | Why It Fails                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Compete on music/nightlife first  | Their home turf; you'll lose   |
| Match their 20% buyer fee ceiling | Race to bottom; lose trust     |
| Ignore their feature parity       | They're modern; respect it     |
| Dismiss them as "small"           | They're growing and hungry     |
| Copy BipPay exactly               | Build something differentiated |

## 🆚 Head-to-Head Scenarios

### Scenario: Concert Organizer Choosing Platform

**Their Pitch:** "0% fees, instant payouts, BipPay for on-site"

**Your Counter:** "Same 0% and instant payouts - but your fans pay 5% max, not 20%. Cheaper tickets = more sales. Plus AI tells you which fans to target for your next show."

### Scenario: Theatre Company Evaluating Options

**Their Pitch:** "We do events too, not just concerts"

**Your Counter:** "When was the last time BIP featured a theatre show on their homepage? We built Tiween for Tunisian culture - theatre, traditional music, art. You're not an afterthought here."

### Scenario: Multi-Event Organizer

**Their Pitch:** "One platform for all your events"

**Your Counter:** "BIP optimized for one type of event. We built flexibility in - your jazz night and your corporate gala get different experiences. One dashboard, infinite event types."
