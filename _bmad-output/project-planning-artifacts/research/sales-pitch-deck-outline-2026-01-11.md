- Tagline: "0% Organizer Fees. Arabic-First. Culture-Focused."

---

### SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Event Ticketing in Tunisia is Broken**

| Problem                  | Impact on You                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Hidden fees           | You don't know your real costs    |
| 📱 No mobile apps        | Fans struggle to buy on phones    |
| 🇫🇷 French-only platforms | Excludes Arabic-speaking audience |
| 📊 No real insights      | You're guessing, not knowing      |
| ⏳ Slow payouts          | Your cash is stuck for weeks      |
| 🎭 One-size-fits-all     | Theatre treated same as nightclub |

**Speaker Notes:**

> "Let me ask you: Do you know exactly what percentage goes to your current platform? Can your fans buy tickets in Arabic? Do you get your money the same day? If you answered 'no' to any of these, you're not alone."

---

### SLIDE 3: The Market Opportunity

**Tunisia's Event Market is Ready for Change**

| Metric          | Value             |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Market Size     | **$12.4M** (2027) |
| Users           | **560,000**       |
| Penetration     | Only **4.2%**     |
| Largest Segment | Sports ($5.3M)    |

**Visual:** Pie chart showing segment breakdown

**Key Insight:**

> "95.8% of Tunisians haven't bought a ticket online yet. The platform that makes it easiest will win."

**Speaker Notes:**

> "This market is tiny but growing. The winner won't be the oldest platform - it'll be the one that removes friction. That's exactly what we built."

---

└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Create** | 5 min     | Event page, ticket types, pricing       |

### SLIDE 6: The Pricing Advantage

**Your Fans Pay Less = You Sell More**

| Platform       | Organizer Fee | Buyer Fee | 1000 Tickets @ 30 TND |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| **Teskerti**   | ~5-10%\*      | Hidden    | You lose ~3,000 TND   |
| **BIP Events** | 0%            | Up to 20% | Fans pay 36 TND each  |
| **Tiween**     | **0%**        | **3-5%**  | Fans pay 31.50 TND    |

\*Teskerti fees not publicly disclosed

**The Math:**

> "At 30 TND ticket price, BIP adds up to 6 TND in fees. We add 1.50 TND. **Your tickets are 15% cheaper.** Cheaper tickets = more sales."

**Visual:** Bar chart comparing final ticket prices

**Speaker Notes:**

> "This isn't about us being cheap. It's about your fans affording more tickets. A family of four saves 18 TND choosing you on Tiween vs BIP."

### SLIDE 7: Feature Comparison

**Why Tiween Wins**

| Feature              | Tiween | Teskerti |    BIP Events    |

| 0% Organizer Fees    |   ✅   |    ❌    |        ✅        |
| Low Buyer Fees (≤5%) |   ✅   |    ❓    |  ❌ (up to 20%)  |
| Mobile App           |   ✅   |    ❌    |        ✅        |

| Instant Payouts      |   ✅   |    ❌    |        ✅        |

**Highlight:** Circle the unique advantages (Arabic-First, Low Buyer Fees, AI Analytics)

**Speaker Notes:**

> "Teskerti has been around since 2014 but still has no mobile app. BIP charges your fans up to 20%. We built what they couldn't - or wouldn't."
