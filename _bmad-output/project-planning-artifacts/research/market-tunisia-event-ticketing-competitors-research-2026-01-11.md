**Geographic Focus:** Tunisia

---

## Executive Summary

The Tunisian event ticketing market is a small but growing segment valued at approximately **US$12 million** (projected 2027), with an estimated **560,000 users** and 4.2% market penetration. The market is characterized by a few dominant local players competing for the "#1" position, each with distinct positioning strategies.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Teskerti** is the established market leader with first-mover advantage (founded 2014), 500,000+ users, VC backing from Flat6Labs, and a strong omnichannel presence (13 physical locations + online)
2. **BIP Events** is the aggressive challenger (founded 2019), differentiating through transparent pricing, zero organizer fees, and modern technology stack
3. **EazyTick** is a technology-focused platform developed during COVID-19, featuring AI capabilities and targeting both Tunisian and international markets
4. **IJA** operates in an adjacent space (venue booking/reservations), creating potential partnership or competitive overlap opportunities

**Strategic Implication for Tiween:** There is a clear gap in the market for a platform that combines the reach of Teskerti, the transparent pricing of BIP Events, and modern event management capabilities tailored for Tunisian cultural events and entertainment.
