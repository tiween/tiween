## 💬 Common Objections & Responses

### "Teskerti is the market leader"

> "They were first, but first isn't always best. When was the last time they innovated? We built Tiween with today's technology and tomorrow's features. Your audience expects a mobile-first experience - Teskerti doesn't even have an app."

### "Everyone knows Teskerti"

> "Brand recognition matters, but so does organizer experience. Ask any Teskerti organizer when they get paid, or try to get real-time analytics. We built Tiween because organizers deserve better tools, not just a familiar name."

### "We've always used Teskerti"

> "And how's that working for you? Are you getting instant payouts? Can you scan tickets offline when the venue WiFi fails? Do you have AI-powered insights about your audience? Switching is free and takes 10 minutes."

### "Teskerti has physical payment locations"

> "That was innovative in 2014. Today, 55% of ticket purchases globally are mobile. We integrate with Flouci, IZI, and all major Tunisian payment apps. Your audience already has these on their phones."

### "They're VC-backed, more stable"

> "Funding doesn't equal quality. We're building sustainably with organizers as our priority, not investor returns. Our 0% organizer fee model means we succeed only when you succeed."

## 🗣️ Positioning Statements

### Against Teskerti (General)

> "Teskerti built ticketing for 2014. We built it for today. Mobile-first, Arabic-first, organizer-first."

### For Price-Sensitive Organizers

> "Why pay Teskerti's hidden fees when Tiween charges organizers 0%? Keep 100% of your ticket revenue."

### For Tech-Savvy Organizers

> "Teskerti's website is fine. But where's the app? The offline mode? The real-time analytics? Tiween has all of it."

### For Cultural Events

> "Teskerti treats all events the same. Tiween was built for Tunisian culture - theatre, music, art. We understand your audience."

### For Growing Organizers

> "Teskerti won't help you understand your audience. Tiween's analytics show you who's buying, when, and why - so you can grow."

## ⚠️ Don't Do This

| Mistake                           | Why It Fails                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Attack their brand directly       | They're trusted; makes us look desperate |
| Compete on physical presence      | We can't win this (yet)                  |
| Promise features we don't have    | Destroys credibility                     |
| Underestimate their relationships | 10 years of partnerships matter          |
| Ignore their loyal customers      | Focus on switchers and new entrants      |
